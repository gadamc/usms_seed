# Notes

What kind of model do I need to build?

The final use case is a swimmer wants to know what seed time to enter for a particular event. 
For example, a 46 year old male wants to seed himself in the 400 IM. He has a swim history
of 100 Free, 100 Fly, 200 Free, 100 IM, 200 IM, etc.  Those swims occurred when the 
swimmer was at a younger age. That information can either be entered
by the swimmer (or could be looked up in the database).
